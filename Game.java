 * This class is the main class of the "Castle of Shmorgenyorg" application.
 * "Castle of Shmorgenyorg" is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users
 * can explore the vicinity of and within the castle. They will discover items
 * and face monsters. 
 * 
 * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 * method.
 * 
 * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 * rooms, creates the parser and starts the game. It also evaluates and
 * executes the commands that the parser returns.
